            <p>p5.js a JS client-side library for creating graphic and interactive experiences, based on the core principles of Processing.</p>
            <p>One of my assignments was to made a poster based on an article about Aristotleâ€™s motion theory, and learning p5.js at the same time.</p>
            <p>p5.js was not necessary to use for the assignments, but I think it was a good chance to investigate new stuff and make something fun! </p>

            <p>Aristotle believed everything was combined with 4 elements: fire, air, water and earth. I coded to change the brush shape to imitate those four elements. Then, I asked my labtop to drew another two posters. When my labtop generating my graphic, I can do something else. It's a really time saving and fun project I never had :)</p>

            <img src="img/p504.jpg" alt="" class="p503">
            <p class="p5last">The inspiration was the word Aristotle said, "To be a thing in the world is to be at work". I thought computure was a thing that working for human, so I asked my laptop to make poster for me, and the title combined Aristotle and AI.</p>
